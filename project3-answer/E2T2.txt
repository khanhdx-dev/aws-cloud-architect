Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
From AWS Inspector, I found some potential security issues on 2 EC2 instances
1. i-01b501d6492c7d21b:
- Port range 0 to 65535 is reachable from an Internet Gateway - UDP
- Port range 0 to 65535 is reachable from an Internet Gateway - TCP
- Port 22 is reachable from an Internet Gateway - TCP
- Port 80 is reachable from an Internet Gateway - TCP
- Port 5000 is reachable from an Internet Gateway - TCP

2. i-0dce41d4c58b25ddd:
- Port 22 is reachable from an Internet Gateway - TCP

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
- I can restrict access to the instance by modifying the Security Groups or ACLs in the network path (Recommend by AWS Inspector).
