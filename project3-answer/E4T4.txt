# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
We can setup a firewalls (WAF) between a client and an application to block suspicious traffic.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
No, as any user or service within the VPC is able to access any Amazon S3 resource thanks to the gateway endpoint's default policy.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
Default encryption is enabled, however existing objects in the bucket retain their original encryption. Once default encryption is enabled, the encryption you choose only applies to upcoming uploads.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
All of the config we made to the initial cloudformation configuration directly through the AWS console would be undone.
